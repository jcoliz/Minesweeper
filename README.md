# Minesweeper Coding Challenge

This is a console game of Minesweeper written in C# on dotnet core.

Recently, I was involved in a timed coding challege to craft such a game. This took me about 1:45 for 
the initial completely working, and then another good 2:00 to refactor it to how I\'d wish I\'d written it.
